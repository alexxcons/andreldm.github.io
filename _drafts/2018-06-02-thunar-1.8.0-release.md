Good news fellow Xfce users, we proudly present the new release Thunar, our beloved easy-to-use and fast filemanager!

The main highlight in the release is that Thunar, as all Xfce components, is saying goodbye to Gtk+ 2 and is now Gtk+ 3 based. Other than that, our team has adressed several critical bugs that affected Thunar stability.
Those bugs fixes were backported to 1.6.x series and we hope our users do not experience crashes anymore.

By the way, by "our team" I mean Alexander Schwinn and myself, as well as all other developers which contributed to the project, specifically Jonas KÃ¼mmerlin, without his work we wouldn't get here.

We picked up where Jonas left off, his initial port saved us a lot of work, with few adjustments we got Thunar to run under Gtk+ 3. But so we discovered this was no easy job, let's just say Gtk+ migration path was far from a smooth experience.
Besides fixing bugs and regressions, some new features were introduced. Not to mention our wonderful work done translators in promptly updating translations.

### What Thunar 1.8.0 has to offer?

* A completely revised pathbar
  * Buttons next/previous/up/home added
  * Click on the right filler opens path as editable string
  * Here's a comparison between the old pathbar and the new one

* GObject Introspection support for thunarx
  * It paves the way to new language bindings
  * Thunarx-python has already been updated

* Many minor improvements:
  * Show file size as well in bytes
  * Add systemd user unit for D-Bus session services
  * Make it possible to assign accelerators to custom actions
  * Enable Thunar UCA (User Configurable Actions) for remote locations
  * Improved various styling details

While moving to Gtk+ 3 it was necessary to replace parts of the thunar plugin API (thunarx). So an update to Thunar 1.8.0 as well requires an update of all installed thunar-plugins.

A complete list of added features, bugfixes and translation changes can be found in the [NEWS file](https://git.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/tree/NEWS){:target="_blank"}.

That's it, we hope you enjoy the new Thunar.
