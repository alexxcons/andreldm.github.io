This is my first post (seriously?). I hope to write many more about my experiments and hacks(kludges)
while playing with technologies such as programming tricks (mostly JavaScript and Java...),  Libraries & Frameworks, software design & architecture, Tools, Linux related things and anything else I find meaningful and useful to share.
This is it, I'll be spend some time tweaking, breaking and improving this Jekyll-based blog until some posts come up.

Cheers,<br>
