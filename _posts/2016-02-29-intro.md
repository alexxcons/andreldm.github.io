This is my first post (seriously?). I hope to write many more about my experiments and hacks(kludges)
while playing with programming languages such as JavaScript and Java, Linux, Raspberry and anything else I find meaningful and useful to share.
For the time being this is it, I'll be spending some time tweaking, breaking and improving this Jekyll-based blog until some posts come up.

Cheers,<br>
